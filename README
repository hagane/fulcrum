To build Fulcrum for Windows, you'll need:

	* SDL 1.2
	* FreeImage 3
	* MS Visual Studio confugured to build using command-line tools
	* Doxygen 1.5(if you want to generate docs)

	To build the library itself, modify paths in Makefile to where your libraries are located and then execute "nmake all" in the command prompt.
	This will produce a directory named "lib", where Fulcrum.dll and Fulcrum.lib will be placed.

	To generate documentation simply execute "doxygen" in the command prompt.
	This will produce a directory named "docs", where documentation will be located.

	Building the library with MinGW is probably possible too.

	GNU/Linux, *BSD, etc is not supported yet.
